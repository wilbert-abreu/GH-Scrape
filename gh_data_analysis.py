# The first step of this is to create a boolean series (just like a matrix is called a dataframe in pandas, a vector is called a series) that contains True for rows that we want to keep, and False for rows that we don't want to.

# user_equals_46578 = progress_frame["user"] == 46578
# user_46578_frame = progress_frame[user_equals_46578]
# The above code will select only the rows of progress_frame where the user column equals 46578, and assigns the result to user_46578_frame.
